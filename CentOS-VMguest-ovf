PREP: Modify the default CentOS 6.8 minimal install to personal preferences

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
!modify ONBOOT and remove UUID, HWADDR and NM_CONTROLLED statements
DEVICE=eth0
TYPE=Ethernet
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=static

/etc/sysconfig/iptables
!modify the icmp permissions to only allow echo and echo-reply:
-A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 0 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT
!configure the catch-all to DROP instead of REJECT
-A INPUT -j DROP

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
!only allow ipv4, by specifying inet for AddressFamily
AddressFamily inet
!forbid root from logging in (use username admin for ssh)
PermitRootLogin no

/etc/sysctl.conf
!disable ipv6 by adding these lines to the bottom:
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
!stripped out declaration for network interface.
!this will be automatically updated during ovf deployment

create local user (so you don't have to login as root)

POST-DEPLOYMENT CONFIG:
1. After deploying the template, bring up a console and login using username admin
 (best practice is to never log in directly as root, so I've created user called admin)
1a. sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
 IPADDR = x.x.x.x
 NETMASK = 255.255.x.x
1b. sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network
 HOSTNAME=testxyz.mydomain
 GATEWAY = x.x.x.1
1c. then restart network service
 sudo service network restart

The VM should now be up & running, answering to ping & SSH.
